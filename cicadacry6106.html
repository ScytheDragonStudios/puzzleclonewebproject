    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <P>This is a project for CodeKentucky, a school program to help break people into tech.</P>
    <p>Cicada3031 was a puzzle site, first revealed back in 2007. <br>
       The last puzzle was released in 2017, but no one knows who exactly cicada was or what they wanted. <br>
       A CIA recruitment trick?  Hacktivists looking for talent? Anonymous?  Speculations fly.</p>

    <h2>Purpose of this site</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this site is 2 fold
        <ol>
            <li>To showcase what I'm learning in CodeLouisville</li>
            <li>To create something I've always wanted to make, a literal website game (puzzle)</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
