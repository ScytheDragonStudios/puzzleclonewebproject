# puzzleclonewebproject
A web puzzle clone for CodeLouisville and personal portfolio
//please note that the first webpage is cicadacry6106.html, so please start there//

This website is a start to a much bigger goal.  To be a software developer has not always been a big dream of mine until recently.  Before this, I wanted to be a game developer, and I studied hard to do that instead.  However, I realized that Web developement and regular software developemnt could be just as fun, so long as I have the time to sit down and focus on them.  This project is a logic puzzle and a point-n-click game called a "Monty Hall" puzzle.  This puzzle is where you have multiple doors and must pick one to be able to pass through.  Only one door is the right one, however, so I have provided clues that you must decipher in order to pick the correct door.

My project contains the following CSS functions:
1. A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon
2. Create your own original CSS animation. For example, create a loading spinner or menu animation. Note: CSS Animations are not included in the assigned Pluralsight channel, you will have to research this on your own (I have two different animation types: Rainbow text and spinning blue loading circle.  I was tempted to try and make something more flashy, but I ran out of time.)

My project contains the following Javascript functions:
1. Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code. I did this by implementing a "Light/Dark mode" function and altering names and code to fit my needs.  

My website is far from perfect, but it's also far from done.  I hope to be able to learn more and come back to this from time to time and improve it.  Maybe add more puzzles.  More functions, like clicking and moving objects.  I will continue learning.  Thank you for your time and I hope you enjoy the logic puzzles!
