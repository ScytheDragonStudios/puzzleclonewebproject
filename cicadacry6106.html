            <P>This is a project for CodeKentucky, a school program to help break people into tech.</P>
            <p>Cicada3031 was a puzzle site, first revealed back in 2007. <br>
       The last puzzle was released in 2017, but no one knows who exactly cicada was or what they wanted. <br>
       A CIA recruitment trick?  Hacktivists looking for talent? Anonymous?  Speculations fly.</p>

            <h2>Purpose of this site</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this site is 2 fold
                    <ol>
                        <li>To showcase what I'm learning in CodeLouisville</li>
                        <li>To create something I've always wanted to make, a literal website game (puzzle)</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <p>I'm not much of a 'Design' person, I am much more comfortable in the back-end part of coding, with C++ or C#.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <p>I sincerely hope you enjoy the logic puzzles, and as I learn I plan to come back and keep improving this site.</p>
